    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
    <div class="last-updated">Last Updated: July 1, 2025</div>
    <p>At B. Miss Nanda, we believe in building a thoughtful and respectful tutoring partnership. These terms are designed to set clear expectations and support a seamless learning experience for every student and family we work with.</p>

    <h2>1. A Learning Partnership</h2>
    <p>Students are accepted by invitation and mutual agreement. Engagement is on a monthly basis and requires written confirmation before sessions begin.</p>

    <h2>2. Steady Rhythm</h2>
    <p>Weekly sessions are set in advance with consistent days and times to support optimal learning flow. Monthly schedules are confirmed at the beginning of each month.</p>

    <h2>3. Life Happens</h2>
    <p>We allow one reschedule per month with at least 24 hours’ notice. Missed sessions without notice are forfeited. If Miss Nanda is unavailable, the session will be made up within the same billing month.</p>

    <h2>4. Clarity in Payments</h2>
    <p>Invoices are issued monthly. Full payment is due before the first session. Trial sessions are invoiced separately and must be paid in advance. Late payment may lead to slot cancellation.</p>

    <h2>5. No Rollovers, No Refunds</h2>
    <p>Payment secures your child’s spot and time. We do not offer refunds, and unused sessions cannot be carried over. We encouraged families to plan schedules mindfully to make the most of every booked sessions.</p>

    <h2>6. Right Fit, Right Time</h2>
    <p>Acceptance depends on the student’s readiness, focus, and learning environment. A trial may be offered before engagement. If the fit isn’t right—wether due to readiness, engagement, or learning environment—we reserve the right to respectfully discontinue the partnership.</p>

    <h2>7. Trusted Privacy</h2>
    <p>We value your trust. Student details—including names, photos, and schools—are never shared without written consent.</p>

    <h2>8. Thoughtful Communication</h2>
    <p>We communicate via WhatsApp and email.<br />
    • Weekend summaries and monthly reflections are shared regularly.<br />
    • Working hours: Mon–Fri, 10.00 – 17.00.<br />
    • Messages outside those hours are answered the next day.<br />
    • During sessions, replies are paused unless urgent.</p>

    <h2>9. Parents as Partners</h2>
    <p>We welcome feedback, insights, and updates from parents. Timely communication helps us tailor each session to meet your child’s evolving needs.</p>

    <h2>10. Where We Learn</h2>
    <p>Sessions are held online or at the student’s home. A quiet, safe, and tidy space is required for home visits.</p>

    <h2>11. Holding Your Spot</h2>
    <p>Slots are reserved monthly with payment. To keep your slot during a break (e.g., holiday or pause), full payment is still required. Otherwise, your slot may be offered to a waitlisted student. Upon return, we cannot guarantee the same schedule — and we thank you for understanding that our availability is limited and in high demand.</p>

    <h2>12. Progress that Speaks</h2>
    <p>Weekly insights are shared via WhatsApp or email. Every four weeks, a reflection summarizes growth, areas for improvement, and next steps.</p>

    <h2>13. Time Well Spent</h2>
    <p>Sessions run for 60 minutes and start on time. Occasional extensions for academic needs may happen at Miss Nanda’s discretion. We kindly ask that families do not expect extended time as default. Time management is part of our shared learning philosophy.</p>

    <h2>14. Staying in the Flow (Extended Session Policy)</h2>
    <p>While we aim to stay within our 60-minute format, there are moments when deep focus, exam readiness, or creative breakthroughs call for extra time.<br />
    If a session runs over by more than 15 minutes, we log it as extended time.<br />
    Families may either:<br />
    • Prepare in advance with monthly extended time credits, or<br />
    • Settle any additional time used at the end of the month through an updated invoce.</p>

    <h2>15. Prepared to Learn</h2>
    <p>We use the student’s school materials. Custom worksheets or additional resources may be provided and may be requested at extra cost.</p>

    <h2>16. Moving with Care</h2>
    <p>A fixed monthly transportation fee applies to all home visits. This fee is thoughtfully calculated based on several factors — including distance, road conditions, peak hours, local climate, and traffic patterns. As each route is unique, the fee may vary between families.</p>

    <h2>17. First Impressions Matter</h2>
    <p>We offer one paid trial session before enrollment. Please note that this does not guarantee a permanent slot. Acceptance is based on alignment with our teaching values and the student’s readiness.</p>

    <h2>18. Data with Dignity</h2>
    <p>Your information stays with us. We never sell or share your data. You may request to access, edit, or delete your information at any time.</p>

    <p><strong>By continuing with our services, you acknowledge and agree to these terms. Updates to this policy will be communicated in advance.</strong></p>
