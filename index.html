    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
    <div class="updated">Last Updated: July 1, 2025</div>
    <p>At B. Miss Nanda, we believe in building a thoughtful and respectful tutoring partnership. These terms are designed to set clear expectations and support a seamless learning experience for every student and family we work with.</p>

    <h2>1. A Learning Partnership</h2>
    <p>Students are accepted by invitation and mutual agreement. Engagement is on a monthly basis and requires written confirmation before sessions begin.</p>

   <h2>2. First Impressions Matter</h2>
    <p>We offer one paid trial session before enrollment to let us explore your child’s learning style, focus, and environment — while giving your family a feel for our approach. Please note that this does not guarantee a permanent slot. Acceptance is based on alignment with our teaching values and the student’s readiness.</p>

    <h2>3. Securing Your Start</h2>
    <p> A one-time registration fee is required to hold your family’s place in our curated schedule. This fee covers the thoughtful intake process — including onboarding, learning profile setup, and first-week preparation — ensuring that each session begins with clarity, structure, and personalized focus.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Steady Rhythm</h2>
    <p>Weekly sessions are set in advance with consistent days and times to support optimal learning flow. Monthly schedules are confirmed at the beginning of each month.</p>

    <h2>5. Life Happens</h2>
    <p>We allow one reschedule per month with at least 24 hours’ notice. Missed sessions without notice are forfeited. If Miss Nanda is unavailable, the session will be made up within the same billing month.</p>

    <h2>6. Public Holidays Are Sacred</h2>
    <p>We honor national public holidays with scheduled breaks. These pauses allow both students and Miss Nanda to rest, reflect, and return with fresh energy. Sessions are not held on these dates, and are not deducted or rescheduled. We appreciate your understanding that this is part of our mindful learning rhythm.</p>
    
    <h2>7. Sundays: Reserved for Renewal</h2>
    <p>Sunday is Miss Nanda’s dedicated rest day and is not available for regular sessions or reschedules. We kindly ask families to schedule sessions on weekdays or Saturdays only to maintain optimal teaching quality, focus, and long-term effectiveness.
<br> For urgent cases such as upcoming exams, Sunday sessions may be arranged upon request with an adjusted rate. This ensures Miss Nanda’s well-being while supporting your child’s immediate needs.</p>
    
    <h2>8. Clarity in Payments</h2>
    <p>Invoices are issued monthly. Full payment is due before the first session. Trial sessions are invoiced separately and must be paid in advance. Late payment may lead to slot cancellation. <br /> Payments can be made via bank transfer, e-wallet, and cash upon request. Detailed payment instructions will be included in each invoice.</p>

    <h2>9. No Rollovers, No Refunds</h2>
    <p>Payment secures your child’s spot and time. We do not offer refunds or carry over unused sessions. Please plan your schedule mindfully to maximize every booked session.</p>

    <h2>10. Right Fit, Right Time</h2>
    <p>Acceptance depends on the student’s readiness, focus, and learning environment. A trial may be offered before engagement. If the fit isn’t right—whether due to readiness, engagement, or learning environment—we reserve the right to respectfully discontinue the partnership.</p>

    <h2>11. Thoughtful Communication</h2>
    <p>We communicate primarily via WhatsApp and email to keep things simple and direct.<br />
    Here’s how we stay connected:<br />
    • Weekend summaries and monthly reflections are shared regularly.<br />
    • Working hours: Mon–Fri, 10.00 – 17.00.<br />
    • Messages outside those hours are answered the next day.<br />
    • During sessions, replies are paused unless urgent.</p>

    <h2>12. Parents as Partners</h2>
    <p>We welcome feedback, insights, and updates from parents. Timely communication helps us tailor each session to meet your child’s evolving needs.</p>

    <h2>13. Where We Learn</h2>
    <p>Sessions are held online or at the student’s home. A quiet, safe, and tidy space is required for home visits.</p>

    <h2>14. Crafting the Experience</h2>
    <p>Each session is thoughtfully supported by digital tools like the iPad, used to bring lessons to life, simplify complex ideas, and support personalized learning. Designed to blend naturally into the flow of teaching. We are committed to delivering a smooth and secure experience, ensuring technology enhances—not interrupts—the educational journey.</p>

    <h2>15. Holding Your Spot</h2>
    <p>Slots are reserved monthly with payment. To keep your slot during a break (e.g., holiday or pause), full payment is still required. Otherwise, your slot may be offered to a waitlisted student. Upon return, we cannot guarantee the same schedule — and we thank you for understanding that our availability is limited and in high demand.</p>

    <h2>16. Progress that Speaks</h2>
    <p>Weekly insights are shared via WhatsApp or email. Every four weeks, a reflection summarizes growth, areas for improvement, and next steps.</p>

    <h2>17. Time Well Spent</h2>
    <p>Sessions run for 60 minutes and start on time. Occasional extensions for academic needs may happen at Miss Nanda’s discretion. We kindly ask that families do not expect extended time as default. Time management is part of our shared learning philosophy.</p>

    <h2>18. Staying in the Flow</h2>
    <p>While we aim to stay within our 60-minute format, there are moments when deep focus, exam readiness, or creative breakthroughs call for extra time.<br />
    If a session runs over by more than 15 minutes, we log it as extended time.<br />
    Families have the option to:<br />
    • Prepare in advance with monthly extended time credits, or<br />
    • Settle any additional time used at the end of the month through an updated invoce.</p>

    <h2>19. Prepared to Learn</h2>
    <p>We use the student’s school materials. Custom worksheets or additional resources may be provided and may be requested at extra cost.</p>

    <h2>20. Moving with Care</h2>
    <p>A fixed monthly transportation fee applies to all home visits. This fee is thoughtfully calculated based on several factors — including distance, road conditions, peak hours, local climate, and traffic patterns. As each route is unique, the fee may vary between families.</p>

    <h2>21. Trusted Privacy</h2>
    <p>We value your trust. All student information—including names, photos, learning materials, school details, and lesson schedules—is kept strictly confidential and never shared or sold without written consent. You are welcome to request access, changes, or deletion of your data at any time. Learn more about how we protect your data in our <a href="https://privacy-policy.bymissnanda.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a></p>

    <p><strong>By continuing with our services, you acknowledge and agree to these terms. Updates to this policy will be communicated in advance.</strong></p>
